Project Title:Simple 4-Bit Computer Built Using Basic Logic Gates

Description:
The 4-Bit Computer Simulator is a hardware simulation project that aims to emulate the functionality of a basic 4-bit computer system. It leverages hardware description language (HDL) and simulation tools to design and simulate the computer's architecture, including the CPU, memory subsystem, and control unit.

Key Features:

    Complete 4-bit computer system with CPU, memory, and control unit
    Instruction set architecture (ISA) supporting essential operations like arithmetic, logic, memory access, and control flow instructions
    Simulated execution environment to run programs written in assembly language
    Assembler program for converting assembly language instructions to machine code compatible with the defined ISA
    Documentation and examples to help understand the project's architecture and usage

Technologies and Tools:

    HDL (Hardware Description Language) for hardware simulation and design
    Simulation tools (e.g., Verilog, VHDL, ModelSim) for testing and validation
